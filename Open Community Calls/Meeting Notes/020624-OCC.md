Under the hood, we use CurveZMQ to encrypt all communication channels between the executor and related nodes."| <ul><li>**Securing HTEX Communication in Parsl**<ul><li>Discusses a new implementation for protecting HTEX communication using zero MQ, an asynchronous messaging library with scalability benefits.</li><li>The current implementation has unencrypted communication channels, making it vulnerable to unauthorized connections, and deploying Parsl in a secure environment can help address this issue.</li></ul></li><li>**Secure Communications Using CurveZMQ**<ul><li>Explains how CurveZMQ uses shared server and client certs for each run, with new certificates generated for each run.</li><li>Installing PyZMQ can result in performance degradation due to dependencies, and provides solutions such as installing via conda or building libsodium and libzmq separately.</li></ul></li></ul>|
