# üí° How to Connect with the Community
Staying connected to each other is an integral part of the Parsl Community. In this section, we go over the communication channels we use to connect, collaborate, get help, and get to know each other.

If you are using Parsl or planning to try it, [join the parsl-project Slack workspace](https://bit.ly/join-parsl-slack) to hear what other users are doing, ask questions, and listen in on and join the community discussion.|
