Our primary daily communication platform is Slack, a cloud-based messaging app. If you are using Parsl or planning to try it, [join the parsl-project Slack workspace](https://bit.ly/join-parsl-slack) to hear what other users are doing, ask questions, and listen in on and join the community discussion.
