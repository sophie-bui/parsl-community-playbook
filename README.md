# Parsl Community Playbook

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This is a dedicated space with information on the strategies, procedures, and activities of the [Parsl](https://github.com/Parsl/parsl) community. This is a public, living space intended to help our community members and collaborators understand our project and understand how to engage and connect with each other.

This playbook is not intended to capture every process. Instead, it serves as a guide to our community by providing an overview of how we operate and points to ways and resources where you can learn more. This playbook was developed in 2024 and is updated annually.
