# Parsl Community Playbook

üëã Welcome! This is a dedicated space with information on the strategies, procedures, and activities of the [Parsl](https://github.com/Parsl/parsl) community. This is a public, living space intended to help our community members and collaborators understand our project and understand how to engage and connect with each other.

This playbook is not intended to capture every process. Instead, it serves as a guide to our community by providing an overview of how we operate and points to ways and resources where you can learn more. This playbook was developed in 2024 and is updated annually.

## Overview
Parsl is an open source software package and community that enables users to parallelize their Python programs and construct workflows, including calls to external executables, and run them scalably and efficiently on small to very large local and remote resources. It serves as a basis for novel computer science research related to parallel and distributed computing, as well as enabling system administrators to support their users via a Python library that integrates with their research environment.

### üí° Motivation Behind Parsl: The Modern Research Computing Landscape
- Software is increasingly *assembled* rather than written ‚Äì high-level language to integrate components from many sources
- Parallel and distributed computing is ubiquitous ‚Äì increasing data sizes & plateauing sequential processing
- Resources are increasingly heterogeneous (distributed) ‚Äì application components best run in different places
- Python (& SciPy ecosystem) de facto standard language ‚Äì libraries, tools, Jupyter, etc.

## üè¶ Funding and Support
Parsl work today is supported by a combination of sources, including an NSF SI2 award in its final year, in-house funding at U Chicago and U Illinois, external funding from projects and collaborations that depend on Parsl and have budgeted to partially support it, volunteer (in-kind) effort from groups that develop tools that use Parsl or add to Parsl‚Äôs capabilities as well as students who come across Parsl and find it useful, research projects that extend Parsl in various ways, and companies that use Parsl in their services.

With grants from NSF and CZI, Parsl is entering its next phase toward sustainability. These awards provide funding to build on existing capabilities, define and implement an open governance structure, improve systems and architecture, enhance the open source process, support a dedicated community manager to prioritize engagement and outreach efforts, increase training and support opportunities, and allow the project to continue to grow and innovate.
