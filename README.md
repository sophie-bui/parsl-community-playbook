# Parsl Community Playbook

üëã Welcome! This is a dedicated space with information on the strategies, procedures, and activities of the [Parsl](https://github.com/Parsl/parsl) community. This is a public, living space intended to help our community members and collaborators understand our project and understand how to engage and connect with each other.

This playbook is not intended to capture every process. Instead, it serves as a guide to our community by providing an overview of how we operate and points to ways and resources where you can learn more. This playbook was developed in 2024 and is updated annually.

## Community Overview

Parsl is an open source software package that parallelizes Python programs, constructs workflows and runs them scalably and efficiently on small to vast local and remote resources. The project‚Äôs first four years involved a small group of funded developers building out the tool and a community of 35 global contributors using Parsl for their work. Since the 1.0 production version release in 2020, the community has grown to over 75 global contributors and 280 members on Slack.

The goal of the community is to accelerate interdisciplinary research across academia and industry and foster a supportive space to contribute and make improvements to Parsl. Members include research software engineers, researchers, scientists, compute resource admins, and developers with varying levels of expertise, domains and disciplines, career levels, and geographic regions. Parsl serves as a basis for novel computer science research related to parallel and distributed computing, as well as enabling system administrators to support their users via a Python library that integrates with their research environment.

Community members discuss their experiences and share their work in several channels. Programming includes providing general support, sharing updates and stories in Slack, tracking and discussing technical issues in GitHub, a bi-weekly open Zoom call, and ParslFest, an annual event for knowledge sharing and networking.

### üß† Motivation Behind Parsl: The Modern Research Computing Landscape
- Software is increasingly *assembled* rather than written ‚Äì high-level language to integrate components from many sources
- Parallel and distributed computing is ubiquitous ‚Äì increasing data sizes & plateauing sequential processing
- Resources are increasingly heterogeneous (distributed) ‚Äì application components best run in different places
- Python (& SciPy ecosystem) de facto standard language ‚Äì libraries, tools, Jupyter, etc.

### üè¶ Funding and Support
Parsl work today is supported by a combination of sources, including an NSF SI2 award in its final year, in-house funding at U Chicago and U Illinois, external funding from projects and collaborations that depend on Parsl and have budgeted to partially support it, volunteer (in-kind) effort from groups that develop tools that use Parsl or add to Parsl‚Äôs capabilities as well as students who come across Parsl and find it useful, research projects that extend Parsl in various ways, and companies that use Parsl in their services.

With grants from NSF and CZI, Parsl is entering its next phase toward sustainability. These awards provide funding to build on existing capabilities, define and implement an open governance structure, improve systems and architecture, enhance the open source process, support a dedicated community manager to prioritize engagement and outreach efforts, increase training and support opportunities, and allow the project to continue to grow and innovate.
