# Parsl Community Playbook

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This is a dedicated space with information on the strategies, procedures, and activities of the [Parsl](https://github.com/Parsl/parsl) community. This is a public, living space intended to help our community members and collaborators understand our project and understand how to engage and connect with each other.

This playbook is not intended to capture every process. Instead, it serves as a guide to our community by providing an overview of how we operate and points to ways and resources where you can learn more. This playbook was developed in 2024 and is updated annually.

## Project Overview
Parsl is an open source software package and community that enables users to parallelize their Python programs and construct workflows, including calls to external executables, and run them scalably and efficiently on small to very large local and remote resources. It serves as a basis for novel computer science research related to parallel and distributed computing, as well as enabling system administrators to support their users via a Python library that integrates with their research environment.

### ðŸ’¡ Motivation Behind Parsl: The Modern Research Computing Landscape
- Software is increasingly *assembled* rather than written â€“ high-level language to integrate components from many sources
- Parallel and distributed computing is ubiquitous â€“ increasing data sizes & plateauing sequential processing
- Resources are increasingly heterogeneous (distributed) â€“ application components best run in different places
- Python (& SciPy ecosystem) de facto standard language â€“ libraries, tools, Jupyter, etc.
