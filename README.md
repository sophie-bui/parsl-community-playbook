# Parsl Community Playbook

👋 Welcome! This is a dedicated space with information on the strategies, procedures, and activities of the [Parsl](https://github.com/Parsl/parsl) community. This is a public, living space intended to help our community members and collaborators understand our project and understand how to engage and connect with each other.

This playbook is not intended to capture every process. Instead, it serves as a guide to our community by providing an overview of how we operate and points to ways and resources where you can learn more. This playbook was developed in 2024 and is updated annually.

## INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW

Parsl is an open source software package and community that enables users to parallelize their Python programs and construct workflows, including calls to external executables, and run them scalably and efficiently on small to very large local and remote resources. It serves as a basis for novel computer science research related to parallel and distributed computing, as well as enabling system administrators to support their users via a Python library that integrates with their research environment.

### 🧠 Motivation Behind Parsl: The Modern Research Computing Landscape
- Software is increasingly *assembled* rather than written – high-level language to integrate components from many sources
- Parallel and distributed computing is ubiquitous – increasing data sizes & plateauing sequential processing
- Resources are increasingly heterogeneous (distributed) – application components best run in different places
- Python (& SciPy ecosystem) de facto standard language – libraries, tools, Jupyter, etc.

### 🏦 Funding and Support
Parsl work today is supported by a combination of sources, including an NSF SI2 award in its final year, in-house funding at U Chicago and U Illinois, external funding from projects and collaborations that depend on Parsl and have budgeted to partially support it, volunteer (in-kind) effort from groups that develop tools that use Parsl or add to Parsl’s capabilities as well as students who come across Parsl and find it useful, research projects that extend Parsl in various ways, and companies that use Parsl in their services.

However, this is not sustainable as is: the resources that are being provided and volunteered are useful for adding features to Parsl, and support a limited number of use cases, but are not sufficiently coordinated or aligned to fully support Parsl’s core needs over multiple years.
